Architecture

1. Testing is done not only on the bytecode generated by the compiler here. Instead a full test where proper inputs are given is done here.

2. Solidity compiler gives bytecode+ABI. Deploy bytecode on a local test ethereum network running on local machines.

3. Create local test network using a library called Ganache(used to be called TestRPC). 

4. Feed ABI to Web3 library, and use this library to access the contract instance.

Testing Framework used : Mocha

Points to note : web3 versioning
2 versions :
    version 0: support for only callbacks for async code
    version 1: support for promises added
    Most communications require async; callbacks not preferred - harder and difficult

Notes on Mocha : Test Running Framework - to test JavaScript apps
    3 major built in functions:
    1. it - run a test and make an assumption; run one individual assertion.
    2. describe - groups together it functions.
    3. beforeEach - execute some general setup code.
