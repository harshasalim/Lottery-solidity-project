Deployment Architecture

Create a web3 instance using the Web3 constructor. 
Give a provider to it, to tell the instance what network it is supposed to be communicating with.
Make sure that we are using an account that has some ether in it on the Rinkeby Network/Test Network.
(Earlier for testing, used Ganache which pregenerated a set of accounts with ether, also no worry of private/public keys)
So here take the account mnemonic, and pass it to the provider.
Also when we deploy to the Rinkeby Network, we have to ensure that there is some node that we can connect to in the network.
One common solution is to run a local node on your machine. However time-consuming and tedious process.
Alternate solution - use a service Infura. It is a public API that can guve access to a node that is hosted on the Rinkeby Network by Infura.
(Infura also has nodes on other networks in Ethereum) 

truffle-hdwallet-provider is a special provider that can connect to an outside node in a network, and also simultaneously unlock the account.
